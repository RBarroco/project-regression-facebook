Predicting Social Media - Linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression and SGDRegressor: <br/>
[Dataset download](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+metrics)<br/>
    
1) Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, SGDRegressor. <br/>
2) A discussion on normalization, data standardization, in linear regression vs. more complex models. <br/>
3) Differences between LASSO and RIDGE regression, which one is better to help in the interpretation vs. prediction approach.
4) Types of scoring methods: R2_score, mean_square_error, root_mean_square_error. <br/>
5) Split data between the training set and the test set. <br/>
6) Polynomial Features and scaling dataset in different degrees and approaches.<br/>
7) Cross-validation method, using different regression methods, including: GridSearchCV, LassoCV, RidgeCV, ElasticNetCV. <br/>
8) Exploratory data analysis by finding outliers, testing the normality of a distribution using the D'Agostino K ^ 2 test. <br/>
9) Resource engineering (One hot Encode) based on categorical data not ordered vs. non-categorical data, in addition to how to better handle 'NaN' data, boxcox for data normalization. <br/>
10) Correlation matrix, heatmap of the correlation matrix and much more. <br/>
