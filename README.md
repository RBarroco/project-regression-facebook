Predicting Social Media - Linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression and SGDRegressor: <br/>
[Dataset download](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+metrics)<br/>
    
1) Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, SGDRegression. <br/>
2) A dicussion about normalization, standarization of the data, in normal linear regression vs. more complex models.<br/>
3) Diferences between LASSO and RIDGE regression, which is more efficient, which is better in helping interpretation vs. predictions.<br>
4) Types of score methods: R2_score, mean_square_error, root_mean_square_error.<br/>
5) Split data between training set and testing set.<br/>
6) Polynomial Features in different degree.<br/>
7) Cross validation method, using different regressions methods inclusive: GridSearchCV, LassoCV, RidgeCV, ElasticNetCV.<br/>
8) Exploratory data analysis finding outliers, testing normality of a distribution using D'Agostino K^2 Test.<br/>
9) Feature Engineering (One hot Encode) based on categorical unordered data vs. non-categorical data, in addition of how to better handle 'NaN' data, boxcox for data normalization as well.<br/>
10) Correlation matrix, heatmap of correlation matrix.<br/>
